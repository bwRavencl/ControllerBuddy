## 📖 Description

ControllerBuddy is an advanced gamepad mapping software that supports the creation of input profiles for complex target applications such as flight simulators.

In addition to the simple mapping of buttons and axes of a physical game controller to keyboard and mouse input, ControllerBuddy also supports feeding input commands to a virtual joystick device (vJoy / uinput).

The goal of ControllerBuddy is to allow the user to control target applications exclusively with a gamepad without ever having to reach for a keyboard or mouse.

## ⬇️ Download and Installation

### 📜 Install-Script

For the easiest way to install and update, use the [ControllerBuddy-Install-Script](https://github.com/bwRavencl/ControllerBuddy-Install-Script).  
It automates all the steps below and much more!

### 📦 Flatpak

Linux users may want to use the [ControllerBuddy-Flatpak](https://github.com/bwRavencl/ControllerBuddy-Flatpak).

### 🧑‍🔧 Manual Installation

#### 🪟 Windows x86-64

1. First download and install [vJoy 2.2.2.0](https://github.com/BrunnerInnovation/vJoy/releases/tag/v2.2.2.0) on your system.
2. [Click here](https://github.com/bwRavencl/ControllerBuddy/releases/latest) and download the latest build of ControllerBuddy for Windows as a ZIP archive.
3. Extract the `ControllerBuddy` directory from the archive to any desired location on your hard-drive.
4. Run `ControllerBuddy.exe` inside the extracted `ControllerBuddy` directory.

#### 🐧 Linux x86-64 / aarch64

    ```
2. Add yourself to the group:
    ```sh
    sudo gpasswd -a "$USER" controllerbuddy
    ```
3. Allow the group to access uinput:
    ```sh
    echo 'KERNEL=="uinput", SUBSYSTEM=="misc", MODE="0660", GROUP="controllerbuddy"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-controllerbuddy.rules
    ```

## 🗃️ Profiles

Profiles are used to configure your gamepad for a specific target application.  
The general structure of a profile is as follows:

```
Profile (.json file)
├── Default Mode
│   ├── X Axis
│   │   ├── some Action
│   │   └── another Action
│   ├── Y Axis
│   │   └── some Action
│   ├── A Button
│   │   ├── some Action
│   │   └── another Action
│   ├── B Button
│   │   └── Switch Mode Action (switches to 'Another Mode' and back)
│   ├── X Button
│   │   └── Switch Mode Action (switches to 'Yet another Mode' and back)
│   └── Y Button
│       └── Cycle Action (performs 'Action 1', when pressed again 'Action 2', then 'Action 3', then starts over)
│           ├── Action 1
│           ├── Action 2
│           └── Action 3
├── Another Mode
│   ├── X Axis
│   │   └── some Action
│   └── A Button
│       └── some Action
└── Yet another Mode
    └── X Axis
        └── some Action
```

When switching from one Mode to another, all the axes and buttons that are not used by the other mode retain their function from the previous mode. This works across multiple levels of modes.

Mode switching can be configured to work in two different ways:

- Default: works like the Shift key on your keyboard
- Toggle: works like the Caps Lock key

The [ControllerBuddy-Profiles](https://github.com/bwRavencl/ControllerBuddy-Profiles) repository contains a number of well-thought-out profiles for many different flight simulators.

If ControllerBuddy is already running, launching a second instance with any of the parameters marked as "available for scripting" will forward the specified action to the first instance and then exit immediately.

This mechanism allows seamless integration of ControllerBuddy into third-party applications.  
For an example, see [ControllerBuddy-DCS-Integration](https://github.com/bwRavencl/ControllerBuddy-DCS-Integration), which demonstrates how ControllerBuddy can be integrated into [DCS World](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com).
